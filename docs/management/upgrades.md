# Upgrades

This section guides you through the process of performing minor and major upgrades for your PostgreSQL cluster.

## Minor Upgrade

Update to a new minor version (e.g., from version 18.1 to 18.2).

### Console (UI)

Minor cluster upgrades are currently supported only through the command line.

:::tip
If you’re interested in having this functionality available through the UI, please consider becoming a [sponsor](/docs/sponsor).
:::

### Command line

By default, only PostgreSQL packages defined in the `postgresql_packages` variable are updated. In addition, you can update Patroni or the entire system.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="postgres" label="Postgres" default>

Update only the PostgreSQL packages.

```
docker run --rm -it \
  -e ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS="-F none" \
  -e ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/project/inventory \
  -v $PWD:/project \
  -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
  autobase/automation:2.7.1 \
    ansible-playbook update_pgcluster.yml -e target=postgres
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="patroni" label="Patroni">

Update only the Patroni package.

```
docker run --rm -it \
  -e ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS="-F none" \
  -e ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/project/inventory \
  -v $PWD:/project \
  -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
  autobase/automation:2.7.1 \
    ansible-playbook update_pgcluster.yml -e target=patroni
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="system" label="System">

Update all system packages (including Postgres and Patroni).

```
docker run --rm -it \
  -e ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS="-F none" \
  -e ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/project/inventory \
  -v $PWD:/project \
  -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
  autobase/automation:2.7.1 \
    ansible-playbook update_pgcluster.yml -e target=system
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Database downtime considerations

When using load balancing for read-only traffic, zero downtime is expected (for read traffic), provided there is more than one replica in the cluster. For write traffic (to the Primary), the expected downtime is ~5-10 seconds.

## Major Upgrade

Upgrade to a new major version (e.g., from version 17 to 18).

### Console (UI)

Major cluster upgrades are currently supported only through the command line.

:::tip
If you’re interested in having this functionality available through the UI, please consider becoming a [sponsor](/docs/sponsor).
:::

### Command line

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="in-place" label="In-place upgrade" default>

**In-place** method upgrades the current production cluster directly. It is simpler and does not require additional servers, but it usually requires a short maintenance window (typically about 1 minute, depending on workload and environment).

:::info Database downtime considerations

To minimize the downtime, we pause PgBouncer pools. This doesn’t terminate application connections, but may temporarily increase query latency while pools are paused. The pause typically lasts ~30-60 seconds, but may be longer for large databases due to pg_upgrade and rsync. The default maximum wait time during a pause is 2 minutes (controlled by the `query_wait_timeout` parameter).
:::

:::note
There is no need to plan additional disk space, because PostgreSQL is upgraded using hard links instead of copying files. However, it is required that the `pg_old_datadir` and `pg_new_datadir` are located within the same top-level directory (`pg_upper_datadir` variable).
:::

#### Before Upgrade

1. Before upgrading to a new major version, it's recommended to update PostgreSQL and its extensions. Additionally, consider updating Patroni and the entire system. See "[Minor Upgrade](#minor-upgrade)" section.
2. Before moving forward, execute preliminary checks to ensure that your database schema is compatible with the upcoming PostgreSQL version and that the cluster is ready for the upgrade.
    - To do this, run the `pg_upgrade` playbook using the tags '`pre-checks,upgrade-check`'.
      - If any errors arise, such as schema object incompatibilities, resolve these issues and repeat the checks.
    - Once the playbook completes the pre-checks without any errors, you should see the following messages in the Ansible log: 
      - "`The database schema is compatible with PostgreSQL <new_version>`"
      - "`Clusters are compatible`"
    - Upon seeing these messages, proceed to run the playbook without any tags to initiate the upgrade.

#### Upgrade

:::note
Specify the current (old) version of PostgreSQL in the `pg_old_version` variable and target version of PostgreSQL for the upgrade in the `pg_new_version` variable.
:::

```
docker run --rm -it \
  -e ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS="-F none" \
  -e ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/project/inventory \
  -v $PWD:/project \
  -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
  autobase/automation:2.7.1 \
    ansible-playbook pg_upgrade.yml -e "pg_old_version=17 pg_new_version=18"
```

#### Rollback

In some scenarios, if errors occur, the `pg_upgrade` playbook may automatically initiate a rollback.
Alternatively, if the automatic rollback does not occur, you can manually execute the `pg_upgrade_rollback` playbook to revert the changes. 

```
docker run --rm -it \
  -e ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS="-F none" \
  -e ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/project/inventory \
  -v $PWD:/project \
  -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
  autobase/automation:2.7.1 \
    ansible-playbook pg_upgrade_rollback.yml -e "pg_old_version=17 pg_new_version=18"
```
:::note
It's designed to be used when a PostgreSQL upgrade hasn't been fully completed and the new version hasn't been started. \
The rollback operation is performed by starting the Patroni cluster with the old version of PostgreSQL using the same PGDATA. \
The playbook first checks the health of the current cluster, verifies the version of PostgreSQL, and ensures the new PostgreSQL is not running.
If these checks pass, the playbook switches back to the old PostgreSQL paths and restarts the Patroni service.
:::


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="blue-green" label="Blue-Green Deployment">

**Blue-green** method upgrades a separate target cluster that is a copy of the current one, so upgrade stages on target do not impact production availability.

This method is suitable when downtime must be limited to a few seconds: during switchover, the source cluster is briefly set to read-only, traffic is redirected to target (by updating PgBouncer pool backend IPs), and you can observe stability before switching the application to the address of the new cluster or rolling back to the source cluster if needed.

<ThemedImage
  alt="postgresql-cluster-scheme"
  sources={{
    light: '/img/blue-green.png',
    dark: '/img/blue-green.dark.png',
  }}
/>

Rollback is possible without losing changes made after cutover, because reverse logical replication is created during traffic switching.

:::info Database downtime considerations

A short service impact occurs only during switchover: the source cluster is briefly set to read-only, the remaining logical replication lag is drained, and traffic is redirected to target. Only the write traffic degrades (~10-15 seconds), while the read traffic has near-zero downtime.
:::

#### 1. Deploy the target cluster

Ensure that the target cluster has the same number of PostgreSQL servers as the source cluster. This is important during switchover when configuring PgBouncer to redirect traffic to the target cluster (if PgBouncer is installed).

:::tip
During Patroni standby cluster deployment, set `source_cluster_host` to the IP address of a source cluster host.
:::

Create `inventory.yml` file. Describe the nodes of the current and target cluster, example:

```yaml
---
all:
  vars:
    cloud_provider: aws
    # upgrade settings
    pg_old_version: 17 # the current (old) version of PostgreSQL
    pg_new_version: 18 # the target (new) version of PostgreSQL for the upgrade
    pg_replication_database: "all" # dbname for replication, 'all' for the entire cluster
    pg_publication_count: 1 # number of publications, replication slots and subscriptions
    # connection settings
    ansible_ssh_user: root
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa
  children:
    source_cluster:
      hosts:
        10.142.0.21:
        10.142.0.22:
        10.142.0.23:
    target_cluster:
      hosts:
        10.142.0.24:
        10.142.0.26:
        10.142.0.43:
```

#### 2. Upgrade the target cluster

Upgrade the target cluster and convert a physical replica into a logical replica.

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS="-F none" \
  -e ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/project/inventory.yml \
  -v $PWD:/project \
  -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
  autobase/automation:2.7.1 \
    ansible-playbook pg_logical_upgrade.yml
```

#### 3. Switchover to the target cluster:

After upgrade is completed and logical replication is active, use `pg_logical_switchover` playbook to switch traffic.

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS="-F none" \
  -e ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/project/inventory.yml \
  -v $PWD:/project \
  -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
  autobase/automation:2.7.1 \
    ansible-playbook pg_logical_switchover.yml
```

:::warning
If PgBouncer is not installed in your cluster, **traffic redirection will not happen** automatically.
:::

:::note
In this case, use the following sequence:
1. Stop your application
2. Run the `pg_logical_switchover` playbook
3. Start your application and point it to the target (new) cluster address
:::

Optionally:

- **Force mode** (allow a small lag during cutover):

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it \
      -e ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS="-F none" \
      -e ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/project/inventory.yml \
      -v $PWD:/project \
      -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
      autobase/automation:2.7.1 \
        ansible-playbook pg_logical_switchover.yml \
        -e "pg_switchover_force_mode=true pg_switchover_force_mode_lag_bytes=1048576"
    ```

- **Rollback** after switchover (if you need to move traffic back to the original cluster):

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it \
      -e ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS="-F none" \
      -e ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/project/inventory.yml \
      -v $PWD:/project \
      -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
      autobase/automation:2.7.1 \
        ansible-playbook pg_logical_switchover_rollback.yml
    ```

#### 4. Switch application to the target cluster

After observing your services and database on the new cluster, if everything is stable, switch your application to the new cluster by updating the connection string with the new cluster address.

#### 5. Stop reverse replication

To clean up logical replication objects after migration (subscriptions, replication slots, and publications), run:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS="-F none" \
  -e ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/project/inventory.yml \
  -v $PWD:/project \
  -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
  autobase/automation:2.7.1 \
    ansible-playbook pg_logical_replication_stop.yml
```

Upgrade Plan:

#### PRE-UPGRADE: Perform Pre-Checks

- **Make sure that the required variables are specified**
  - Notes: `pg_old_version` and `pg_new_version` variables
  - Stop, if one or more required variables have empty values.
- **Make sure that the old and new data and config directories do not match**
  - Stop, if `pg_old_datadir` and `pg_new_datadir`, or `pg_old_confdir` and `pg_new_confdir` match.
- **Make sure the ansible required Python library is installed**
  - Notes: Install 'pexpect' package if missing
- **Test PostgreSQL database access using a unix socket**
  - if there is an error (no pg_hba.conf entry):
    - Add temporary local hba rule (during the upgrade)
    - Update the PostgreSQL configuration
- **Check the current version of PostgreSQL**
  - Stop, if the current version does not match `pg_old_version`
  - Stop, if the current version greater than or equal to `pg_new_version`. No upgrade is needed.
