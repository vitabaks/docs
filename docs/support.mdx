# Support

We provide personalized support and expert assistance, so you can focus on building your project with confidence, knowing that a reliable partner is always available when you need help.

Each Autobase package (except for the “Basic” plan) includes DBA as a Service (DBAaaS)—giving you direct access to a dedicated PostgreSQL expert (DBA).
You’ll also gain access to a private Slack channel for real-time communication and support.

#### Choose the support plan that fits your needs:
