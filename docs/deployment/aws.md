# AWS

Amazon Web Services

**[Autobase](https://github.com/vitabaks/autobase)** will automatically set up the following in Amazon Web Services (AWS):

1. AWS EC2 Instances - a virtual machine (with a dedicated data disk), with all cluster components installed and configured.
2. AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to serve as the entry point for database connections.
3. AWS S3 Bucket, and configured backups using pgBackRest.

:::info
All components are installed within your cloud account.
:::

#### Prerequisites

You will need the access key (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) to deploy the PostgreSQL cluster to your AWS account.
See the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) for instructions on creating an access key.

:::note
You can either add these credentials in advance on the **Settings** page under the **Secrets** tab, or you will be prompted to enter them during the cluster creation process.

#### 1. Set AWS credentials

Export your AWS access key to an environment variable:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<value>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<value>
```

#### 2. Run the Deployment Command

Execute the following command to deploy a PostgreSQL cluster (example):

```
docker run --rm -it \
  --env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} \
  --env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} \
  autobase/automation:2.3.0 \
    ansible-playbook deploy_pgcluster.yml --extra-vars \
      "ansible_user=ubuntu \
       cloud_provider='aws' \
       cloud_load_balancer=true \
       server_count=3 \
       server_type='m6i.xlarge' \
       server_image='ami-063fb82b183efe67d' \
       server_location='us-east-1' \
       volume_size=100 \
       postgresql_version=17 \
       patroni_cluster_name='postgres-cluster-01' \
       ssh_public_keys='ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAA******whzcMINzKKCc7AVGbk='"
```

Key Parameters:
- `cloud_provider`: Specifies Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the provider.
- `cloud_load_balancer`: Adds a AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to the cluster.
- `server_count`: Number of servers in the cluster (at least 3 servers are needed for high availability).
- `server_type`: Type of servers (e.g., 'm6i.xlarge' for 4 vCPU 16 GB RAM).
- `server_image`: Operating system image for the servers (e.g., 'ami-063fb82b183efe67d' for Ubuntu 24.04).
- `server_location`: Server location (e.g., 'us-east-1' for US East N. Virginia).
- `volume_size`: Disk size (in GB) for the database.
- `postgresql_version`: PostgreSQL version.
- `patroni_cluster_name`: PostgreSQL cluster name.
- `ssh_public_keys`: Your SSH public key to access the database servers after deployment.
