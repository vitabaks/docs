**[autobase](https://github.com/vitabaks/autobase)** will automatically set up the following in Azure:

1. Azure Virtual Machines (with a dedicated data disk), with all cluster components installed and configured.
2. Azure Load Balancer to serve as the entry point for database connections.
3. Azure Blob Storage, and configured backups using pgBackRest.

:::info
All components are installed within your cloud account.
