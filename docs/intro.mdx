# Introduction

**[postgresql_cluster](https://github.com/vitabaks/postgresql_cluster)** automates the deployment and management of highly available PostgreSQL clusters in production environments. This solution is tailored for use on dedicated physical servers, virtual machines, and within both on-premises and cloud-based infrastructures.

### Supported setups of Postgres Cluster

import SchemeSwitcher from '@site/src/components/SchemeSwitcher.mdx';

For a detailed description of the cluster components, visit the [Architecture](./overview/architecture.md) page.

## Getting Started

You have the option to easily deploy Postgres clusters using the Console (UI) or from the command line with the ansible-playbook command.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="console-ui" label="Console (UI)" default>

The Console (UI) is the recommended method for most users. It is designed to be user-friendly, minimizing the risk of errors and making it easier than ever to set up your PostgreSQL clusters. This method is suitable for both beginners and those who prefer a visual interface for managing their PostgreSQL clusters.

#### Run the Console container

To run the PostgreSQL Cluster Console, execute the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name pg-console \
  --publish 80:80 \
  --publish 8080:8080 \
  --env PG_CONSOLE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1 \
  --env PG_CONSOLE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN=secret_token \
  --volume console_postgres:/var/lib/postgresql \
  --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  --volume /tmp/ansible:/tmp/ansible \
  --restart=unless-stopped \
  vitabaks/postgresql_cluster_console:2.0.0
```

:::tip
It is recommended to run the console in the same network as your database servers to enable monitoring of the cluster status. In this case, replace `localhost` with your server's IP address in the PG_CONSOLE_API_URL variable.
:::

#### Open the Console UI

Go to http://localhost/ and use `secret_token` for authorization.

:::note
- If you have set up the console on a different server, replace 'localhost' with the server's address.
- Use the value of your token if you have redefined it in the PG_CONSOLE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN variable.

  <TabItem value="command-line" label="Command line">

The command line mode is suitable for advanced users who require greater flexibility and control over the deployment and management of their PostgreSQL clusters.
While the Console (UI) is designed for ease of use and is suitable for most users, the command line provides powerful options for those experienced in automation and configuration.

1. [Install Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) on one control node (which could easily be a laptop)

    Example:
    ```shell
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-pip sshpass git
    pip3 install ansible
    ```

2. Download the postgresql_cluster repository

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/vitabaks/postgresql_cluster.git
    ```

3. Go to the automation directory

    ```shell
    cd postgresql_cluster/automation
    ```

4. Install requirements on the control node

    ```shell
    ansible-galaxy install --force -r requirements.yml 
    ```

    :::note
    If you plan to use Consul (`dcs_type: consul`), install the consul role requirements
    ```
    ansible-galaxy install -r roles/consul/requirements.yml
    ```
