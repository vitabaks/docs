# Introduction

**[Autobase for PostgreSQLÂ®](https://github.com/vitabaks/autobase)** automates the deployment and management of highly available PostgreSQL clusters in production environments. This solution is tailored for use on dedicated physical servers, virtual machines, and within both on-premises and cloud-based infrastructures.

### Supported setups of Postgres Cluster

For a detailed description of the cluster components, visit the [Architecture](./overview/architecture.md) page.

## Getting Started

You have the option to easily deploy Postgres clusters using the Console (UI), command line, or GitOps.

Deploying and managing PostgreSQL clusters can be challenging, especially without a dedicated database administrator (DBA).
With **Autobase**, it becomes simpler: alongside powerful automation tools, you get **DBA as a Service (DBAaaS)**.
This means access to PostgreSQL experts who will assist with deployment, maintenance, and optimization, ensuring your clusters run smoothly.

Explore our [support packages](/docs/support) to find a plan that fits your needs.
