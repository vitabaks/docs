# Introduction

**[Autobase for PostgreSQLÂ®](https://github.com/vitabaks/autobase)** automates the deployment and management of highly available PostgreSQL clusters in production environments. This solution is tailored for use on dedicated physical servers, virtual machines, and within both on-premises and cloud-based infrastructures.

### Supported setups of Postgres Cluster

import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';

  }}
/>

For a detailed description of the cluster components, visit the [Architecture](./overview/architecture.md) page.

## Getting Started

You have the option to deploy Postgres clusters using the Console (UI), command line, or GitOps.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="console-ui" label="Console (UI)" default>

The Console (UI) is the recommended method for most users. It is designed to be user-friendly, minimizing the risk of errors and making it easier than ever to set up your PostgreSQL clusters. This method is suitable for both beginners and those who prefer a visual interface for managing their PostgreSQL clusters.

#### Run the Autobase console

To run the autobase console, execute the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name autobase-console \
  --publish 80:80 \
  --env PG_CONSOLE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN=secret_token \
  --volume console_postgres:/var/lib/postgresql \
  --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  --volume /tmp/ansible:/tmp/ansible \
  --restart=unless-stopped \
  autobase/console:2.3.2
```

Alternatively, you can use [Docker Compose](https://github.com/vitabaks/autobase/blob/2.3.2/console/docker-compose.yml).

:::info
It is recommended to run the console in the same network as your database servers to enable monitoring of the cluster status.
:::

#### Open the Console UI

Go to http://localhost:80 (or the address of your server) and use `secret_token` for authorization.

Refer to the [Deployment](./docs/category/deployment) section to learn more about the different deployment methods.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="command-line" label="Command line">

The command line mode is suitable for advanced users who require greater flexibility and control over the deployment and management of their PostgreSQL clusters.
While the Console (UI) is designed for ease of use and is suitable for most users, the command line provides powerful options for those experienced in automation and configuration.

#### Run the Autobase automation

All dependencies and source code are bundled into the `autobase/automation` docker image.
This means the deployment process comes down to simply launching a container with a few variable overrides. For example:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS="-F none" \
  -e ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/project/inventory \
  -v $PWD:/project \
  -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
  autobase/automation:2.3.2 \
    ansible-playbook deploy_pgcluster.yml --extra-vars \
      "postgresql_version=17 \
       patroni_cluster_name=postgres-cluster"
```

Refer to the [Deployment](./docs/category/deployment) section to learn more about the different deployment methods.

:::info
Alternatively, you can use [Ansible Collection](https://github.com/vitabaks/autobase/blob/2.3.2/automation/README.md)
:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="gitops" label="GitOps (CI/CD)">

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows you to manage and provision database infrastructure through code instead of manual processes.
GitOps builds on this by automating infrastructure updates using a Git workflow combined with continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

#### Configure CI/CD

Refer to the [GitOps](docs/management/gitops) section to learn how to integrate Autobase into your CI/CD pipelines.

#### Purchase a Support Package

Deploying and managing PostgreSQL clusters can be challenging, especially without a dedicated database administrator (DBA).
With **Autobase**, it becomes simpler: alongside powerful automation tools, you get **DBA as a Service (DBAaaS)**.
This means access to PostgreSQL experts who will assist with deployment, maintenance, and optimization, ensuring your clusters run smoothly.

Explore our [support packages](/docs/support) to find a plan that fits your needs.
